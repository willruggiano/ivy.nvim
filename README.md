An [ivy-mode](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#ivy) port to neovim. Ivy is a
generic completion mechanism for ~~Emacs~~ Nvim

</div>

## Installation

### Manually

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AdeAttwood/ivy.nvim ~/.config/nvim/pack/bundle/start/ivy.nvim
```

### Plugin managers

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
    "AdeAttwood/ivy.nvim",
    build = "cargo build --release",
},
```

Using [mini.deps](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.deps)

```lua
local deps = require "mini.deps"
deps.later(function() -- Or `deps.now` if you want this to be loaded immediately
  local build = function(args)
    local obj = vim
      .system(
        { "cargo", "build", "--release", string.format("%s%s%s", "--manifest-path=", args.path, "/Cargo.toml") },
        { text = true }
      )
      :wait()
    vim.print(vim.inspect(obj))
  end

  deps.add {
    source = "AdeAttwood/ivy.nvim",
    hooks = {
      post_install = build,
      post_checkout = build,
    },
  }
end)
```

### Setup / Configuration

Ivy can be configured with minimal config that will give you all the defaults
provided by Ivy.

```lua
require("ivy").setup()
```

With Ivy you can configure your own backends.

```lua
require("ivy").setup {
  backends = {
    -- A backend module that will be registered
    "ivy.backends.buffers",
    -- Using a table so you can configure a custom keymap overriding the
    -- default one.
    { "ivy.backends.files", { keymap = "<C-p>" } },
  },
}
```

The `setup` function can only be called once, if its called a second time any
backends or config will not be used. Ivy does expose the `register_backend`
function, this can be used to load backends before or after the setup function
is called.

```lua
require("ivy").register_backend "ivy.backends.files"
```

### Compiling

For the native searching, you will need to compile the shard library. You can
do that by running the below command in the root of the plugin.

```sh
cargo build --release
```

You will need to have the rust toolchain installed. You can find more about
that [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

If you get a linker error you may need to install `build-essential` to get
`ld`. This is a common issue if you are running the [benchmarks](#benchmarks)
in a VM

```
error: linker `cc` not found
  |
  = note: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

To configure auto compiling you can use the [`post-merge`](./post-merge.sample)
git hook to compile the library automatically when you update the package. This
works well if you are managing your plugins via git. For an example
installation you can run the following command. **NOTE:** This will overwrite
any post-merge hooks you have already installed.

```sh
cp ./post-merge.sample ./.git/hooks/post-merge
```

## Features

### Backends

A backend is a module that will provide completion candidates for the UI to
show. It will also provide functionality when actions are taken. The Command
and Key Map are the default options provided by the backend, they can be
customized when you register it.

| Module                               | Command            | Key Map     | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ivy.backends.files`                 | IvyFd              | \<leader\>p | Find files in your project with a custom rust file finder   |
| `ivy.backends.ag`                    | IvyAg              | \<leader\>/ | Find content in files using the silver searcher             |
| `ivy.backends.rg`                    | IvyRg              | \<leader\>/ | Find content in files using ripgrep cli tool                |
| `ivy.backends.buffers`               | IvyBuffers         | \<leader\>b | Search though open buffers                                  |
| `ivy.backends.lines`                 | IvyLines           |             | Search the lines in the current buffer                      |
| `ivy.backends.lsp-workspace-symbols` | IvyWorkspaceSymbol |             | Search for workspace symbols using the lsp workspace/symbol |

### Actions

Action can be run on selected candidates provide functionality

| Action              | Key Map   | Description                                                      |
| ------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Complete            | \<CR\>    | Run the completion function, usually this will be opening a file |
| Vertical Split      | \<C-v\>   | Run the completion function in a new vertical split              |
| Split               | \<C-s\>   | Run the completion function in a new split                       |
| Destroy             | \<C-c\>   | Close the results window                                         |
| Clear               | \<C-u\>   | Clear the results window                                         |
| Delete word         | \<C-w\>   | Delete the word under the cursor                                 |
| Next                | \<C-n\>   | Move to the next candidate                                       |
| Previous            | \<C-p\>   | Move to the previous candidate                                   |
| Next Checkpoint     | \<C-M-n\> | Move to the next candidate and keep Ivy open and focussed        |
| Previous Checkpoint | \<C-M-n\> | Move to the previous candidate and keep Ivy open and focussed    |

Add your own keymaps for an action by adding a `ftplugin/ivy.lua` file in your config.
Just add a simple keymap like this:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(
  "n",
  "<esc>",
  "<cmd>lua vim.ivy.destroy()<CR>",
  { noremap = true, silent = true, nowait = true }
)
```

## API

### ivy.run

The `ivy.run` function is the core function in the plugin, it will launch the
completion window and display the items from your items function. When the
users accept one of the candidates with an [action](#actions), it will call the
callback function to in most cases open the item in the desired location.

```lua
  ---@param name string
  ---@param items fun(input: string): { content: string }[] | string
  ---@param callback fun(result: string, action: string)
  vim.ivy.run = function(name, items, callback) end
```

#### Name `string`

The name is the display name for the command and will be the name of the buffer
in the completion window

#### Items `fun(input: string): { content: string }[] | string`

The items function is a function that will return the candidates to display in
the completion window. This can return a string where each line will be a
completion item. Or an array of tables where the `content` will be the
completion item.

#### Callback `fun(result: string, action: string)`

The function that will run when the user selects a completion item. Generally
this will open the item in the desired location. For example, in the file
finder with will open the file in a new buffer. If the user selects the
vertical split action it will open the buffer in a new `vsplit`

#### Example

```lua
  vim.ivy.run(
    -- The name given to the results window and displayed to the user
    "Title",
    -- Call back function to get all the candidates that will be displayed in
    -- the results window, The `input` will be passed in, so you can filter
    -- your results with the value from the prompt
    function(input)
      return {
        { content = "One" },
        { content = "Two" },
        { content = "Three" },
      }
    end,
    -- Action callback that will be called on the completion or checkpoint actions.
    -- The currently selected item is passed in as the result.
    function(result)
      vim.cmd("edit " .. result)
    end
  )
```

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks are of various tasks that ivy will do. The purpose of the benchmarks
are to give us a baseline on where to start when trying to optimize performance
in the matching and sorting, not to put ivy against other tools. When starting
to optimize, you will probably need to get a baseline on your hardware.

There are fixtures provided that will create the directory structure of the
[kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) source code, from
somewhere around commit sha 985c9202ccd250a5fe22c01faf0d8f83d804b9f3. This will
create a directory tree of 23511 files a relative large source tree to get a
good idea of performance. To create the source tree under
`/tmp/ivy-trees/kubernetes` run the following command. This will need to be run
for the benchmarks to run.

```bash
# Create the source trees
bash ./scripts/fixtures.bash

# Run the benchmark script
luajit ./scripts/benchmark.lua
```

Current benchmark status running on a `e2-standard-2` 2 vCPU + 8 GB memory VM
running on GCP.
